* topologymgr
    * Insert F-PCE address as input parameter for NOX (and remove stub!)

    * Test correct behaviour of the "host discovery" (inherited from
      host_tracking application)
        ** Authenticator related events seem be not able to provide correct
           values for the "in_port" field (it justifies the adoption of this
           alternative method)
        ** Insert "hosts_leave" events handling. It is a known problem also for
           other developers

    * Call F-PCE functions and test its functionalities

    * Fill F-PCE DB with topology values retrieved from underlying switches:
        ** Insert proper translation to map OF data structure into structure
           handled by F-PCE

* of_discovery application:
    * Verify the correct retrieval of the flow tables for all connected OF
      switches
        ** Add response handling to retrieve received stats from switches
    * Move functions which handle events (e.g. flow_stats_recv) into
      ReceiverHandler class
