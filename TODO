* topologymgr
    * Move module from pox/ext into a proper folder and modify related imports

    * Insert F-PCE address as input parameter for NOX (and remove stub!)

    * Call F-PCE functions and test its functionalities

    * Fill F-PCE DB with topology values retrieved from underlying switches:
        ** Insert proper translation to map OF data structure into structure
           handled by F-PCE

* of_discovery application:
    * Verify the correct retrieval of the flow tables for all connected OF
      switches
        ** Add response handling to retrieve received stats from switches
    * Move functions which handle events (e.g. flow_stats_recv) into
      ReceiverHandler class
    * Verify the correct values for adjacences (i.e. _connection member of the
      OFSwitch class)
