1) Start mininet with the following command:

   sudo mn --topo linear --mac --switch user --controller remote

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Open vSwitch seems not support the LLDP protocol. In fact,
if we launch the mininet with the options --switch ovsk the NOX controller will
not receive any Packet-IN with the encapsulted LLDP packets. In that case the
discovery application cannot discover any links.
For our purpose, the option "--switch user" MUST BE USED (1)

   This command will create the following simple topology:

        s1===========s2
        ||           ||
        ||           ||
        ||           ||
        h3           h4
    (10.0.0.3)    (10.0.0.4)

2) Start NOX (from the folder nox-classic/build/src) with the following
   command:

    ./nox_core -v -i ptcp:6633 pyswitch discovery pytopology

3) Verify the correct behaviuor of the discovery application. In particular,
   the port_status_change() function must be called whenever a port status
   change is detected.

(1) In order to use user reference switch, it is required to get 
    openflow source code:
    1) git clone git://openflow.org/openflow.git
    2) boot-configure-make-make install
