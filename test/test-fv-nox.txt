1) Configure FlowVisor:
    * sudo fvconfig generate config.json
    * Edit /etc/flowvisor/config.json by changing the default listening port:
        "listen_port": 7733
    * sudo fvconfig load /etc/flowvisor/config.json (to load conf into DB)
    * sudo make install (in order to apply the configuration changes)

    * Useful command to dump current config: fvctl dumpConfig conf.json

2) Start mininet with the following command:

   sudo mn --topo linear --switch user --controller remote,port=7733

or
   sudo mn --custom <path>/mininet_2h-2s.py --topo=mytopo --switch user --controller=remote,port=7733

WARNING: Mininet MUST be run without option --mac in order to avoid that OF
switches use SAME MAC address used by hosts!!

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Open vSwitch seems not support the LLDP protocol. In fact,
if we launch the mininet with the options --switch ovsk the NOX controller will
not receive any Packet-IN with the encapsulted LLDP packets. In that case the
discovery application cannot discover any links.
For our purpose, the option "--switch user" MUST BE USED (1)

   This command will create the following simple topology:

        s1===========s2
        ||           ||
        ||           ||
        ||           ||
        h3           h4
    (10.0.0.3)    (10.0.0.4)

3) Start NOX (from the folder nox-classic/build/src) with the following
   command:

    ./nox_core -v -i ptcp:6633 discovery_packet core_manager

4) Verify the correct behaviuor of the discovery application. In particular,
   the port_status_change() function must be called whenever a port status
   change is detected.

(1) In order to use user reference switch, it is required to get
    openflow source code:
    1) git clone git://openflow.org/openflow.git
    2) boot-configure-make-make install


Some useful procedures and/or commands for testing:

To force an "host_leave event":
* In netapps/authenticator/authenticator_util.cc decrease the value for
  DEFAULT_IDLE_TIMEOUT
* In Mininet launch the following command:
  link s1 h1 down
