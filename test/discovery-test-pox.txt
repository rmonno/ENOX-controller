1) Start mininet with the following command:

   sudo mn --topo linear --mac --switch user --controller remote

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Open vSwitch seems not support the LLDP protocol. In fact,
if we launch the mininet with the options --switch ovsk the NOX controller will
not receive any Packet-IN with the encapsulted LLDP packets. In that case the
discovery application cannot discover any links.
For our purpose, the option "--switch user" MUST BE USED

   This command will create the following simple topology:

        s1===========s2
        ||           ||
        ||           ||
        ||           ||
        h3           h4
    (10.0.0.3)    (10.0.0.4)

2) Start POX (from the folder pox/) with the following command:

    ./pox.py
