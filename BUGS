Topology Manager
* A network node with IP addr = 0.0.0.0 is created (probably it is an OF
  switch). Verify the host_auth and host_bind events handling

* Fixed host_leave events hadnling when multiple events are raised

* Delete all DB entries and F-PCE topology when NOX is stopped (necessary?)

* Add ip_addr as promary key for hosts table
