# Python L2 learning switch
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This app functions as the control logic of an L2 learning switch for
# all switches in the network. On each new switch join, it creates
# an L2 MAC cache for that switch.
#
# In addition to learning, flows are set up in the switch for learned
# destination MAC addresses.  Therefore, in the absence of flow-timeout,
# pyswitch should only see one packet per flow (where flows are
# considered to be unidirectional)
