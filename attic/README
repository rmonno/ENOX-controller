It is a brief description of the file cointained in this folder:

* topologymgr_host_event: It is a version of the topologymgr that uses the
                          information retrieved from auth/bind/join events of
                          the authenticator application. Problems with the
                          wrong values for the "in_port" field suggest to not
                          adopt this solution
